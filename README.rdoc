        provider = basic
        url = http://takafansubs.com/?p=torrents
        prefix = http://takafansubs.com/
        regex = <a href='(torrents/.*.torrent)'>\[Taka\] Naruto Shippuuden (\d*) 720p</a>
        startnum = 1

<b>enabled</b>: Simple enough enables or disables this series.

<b>name</b>: Name of your series, should not contain spaces.

<b>provider</b>: The provider used for this series, custom providers can be created and called from here.

<b>url</b>: The url we will crawl searching for torrents.

<b>prefix</b>: Optional configuration to prepend to found torrents, this is useful if the site does not give absolute URLs.

<b>regex</b>: Regular expression to find our torrents. <b>There needs to be two () blocks</b>, one around the url and on around the episode number.

After you have the module installed edit <b>Config/torrent_tracker.conf</b>,
towards the bottom you notice a portion for SMS configuration.

        # Configuration for the SMS notifier
        enable_sms = False
        gmail_username = nobody@gmail.com
        gmail_password = empty
        cellnumber = 555-555-5555

Go ahead and set <b>enable_sms</b> to True and fill in your Google Voice info, 
then put in the cellnumber you wish to notify.

        # Configuration for the Email notifer
        enable_email = False
        toaddr = nobody@nowhere.com
